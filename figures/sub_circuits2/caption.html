<div data-label="350127">Sub-circuit simulation topologies</div><div data-label="350127">Each number corresponds to its respective experiment. For better visualization all baseline nodes are excluded from the topologies. A. Single neural population driven by baseline activity. This topology&nbsp; reminds of the fact that all MA, SA, G and GK populations are driven initially in the same way by a persistent baseline fixed rate. B. Closed loop formed by MA, SA and Gs. C. Chain of populations formed by MA, SA and G. D. Closed loop broken by the addition of GKs. E. Chain of populations where activity is temporally interrupted by a control node.</div>
