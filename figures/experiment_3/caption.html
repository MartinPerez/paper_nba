<div data-label="197355">Closed loop activity and memory sub-circuit activation regions</div><div data-label="197355">Plots at the top show an example steady state and max activity rate of the event combination with weaker rate dynamics, in contrast to the steady state rate of the closed loop enhanced activity formed by WM activation. Plots at the bottom identify the parameter regions, where the WM steady state rate (SSR) and maximum rate (MR) threshold region is the one that gives most constrained range of circuit parameters to offer the most flexible coordination of input and control events. The event rate curves correspond to an input rate of 10Hz and 25Hz for the LIF and AdEx models respectively.&nbsp;</div>
