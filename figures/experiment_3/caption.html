A. Example steady state and max activity rate of the event combination with weaker rate dynamics, in contrast to the steady state rate of the closed loop enhanced activity formed by WM activation. B. Parameter regions, where the WM steady state rate (SS) and maximum rate (Max) of respective coordination events delimit WM activation regions. The event rate curves correspond to an input rate of 10Hz and 25Hz for the LIF and AdEx models respectively.Â &nbsp;</div>
